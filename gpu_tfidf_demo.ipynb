The document with the smallest distance (or highest similarity) to our query is the most relevant document to our keywords. We chose to use the cosine similarity.

Cluster centers (or cluster centroid) are simply the cluster’s mean. KMeans require us to provide the number of cluster k beforehand. Ideally, we want to choose the number of clusters carefully. One technique to find a good number of clusters is the Elbow Method. Essentially, the method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters.

        "KMeans helps us find clusters for our data, but the resulting matrix is highly-dimensional with 30 components which is hard to represent on a 2D plane. In order to visualize those clusters, we will use the t-SNE algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of our data. t-SNE models each high-dimensional object by a n-dimensional point (for instance `n=2`) in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability. In our case, t-SNE will help us find a low dimensional data representation that keeps close points together in the 2D space. With this 2D representation, we will see more clearly if our KMeans worked as clusters should be visible on the plot."

        "We can clearly see different groups of clusters, pretty good! Of course it’s not perfect as some clusters seem to be merging with others like deep blue with deep orange, or deep blue with green, but others are completely separated like deep red, black or cyan. This is expected as we could have done a better job of choosing the number of clusters cleverly instead of picking 10 arbitrarily. Added to the fact that this dataset is made of real tweets, which means uncleaned data and outliers, this result seems pretty good. Let’s draw markers for the two earlier tweets from cluster 4 with a black colored X and add a tweet from cluster 6 with a red cross."
